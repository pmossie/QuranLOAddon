# QuranLOAddon

**QuranLOAddon** is a powerful LibreOffice extension that enables you to seamlessly integrate Quranic text into your documents. It not only allows the insertion of Arabic verses but also provides translations and transliterations — enriching your work with clarity, depth, and accessibility.

By default, the extension uses the fonts defined in your LibreOffice settings. However, QuranLOAddon also lets you customize the fonts and font sizes. In the Arabic font selection box, only fonts that support Arabic script are displayed for your convenience.

### Recommended Arabic Fonts

For optimal results, the following fonts are recommended:

* **Scheherazade** – Available at [https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/](https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/)
  This font supports advanced “smart features,” allowing you to fine-tune the appearance. You can even generate a custom version of the font with your preferred feature settings.

* **KFGQPC Uthmanic Script HAFS** – Available at [http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/)

Other Arabic fonts may produce mixed results. Some lack parentheses or standard Arabic numerals. QuranLOAddon attempts to mitigate these issues through built-in character substitutions where possible.
