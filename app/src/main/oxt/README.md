LibreOffice extension to add Qur'an text to a document. It allows you to select a complete
surah or a range of ayats of a surah.

The standard font is selected from the LibreOffice Basic Fonts (CTL) setting.
It uses the Default font and its Fontsize. The Font and Fontsize can be overridden by setting
it on the selection dialog. The Arabic Font Selection box shows only fonts that support the Arabic
characters on your system.

Arabic fonts that gives good results are:
**Scheherazade**, **me_quran**, **Al Qalam Quran Majeed**, **Al Qalam Quran Majeed 1**, **Al Qalam
Quran Majeed 2**.

* **Scheherazade** This you can find at <https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/>.
  Using so called smart features, you can fine tune the font. You can generate your own font with
  the smart features set to your liking.

Other Arabic fonts give mixed results. Some don't have the parenthesis or even the standard Arabic
numbers. I tried to mitigate for that by providing substitutions.

Urdu fonts that gives good results are: **Noto Nastaliq Urdu**

To build the extension I used the LibreOffice Eclipse plugin for extension development:
<https://libreoffice.github.io/loeclipse/>. It also provides a starter project that you can use as
an example.

The Qur'an text and its translations were provided by <https://tanzil.net>:
